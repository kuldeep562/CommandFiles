# 🛠️ Command Files Vault

This repository contains quick reference command files for daily development and operations.  
It’s a **personal cheatsheet repo** where I store all the commands I frequently use for **Git**, **Docker**, **Linux**, and more (to be added later like Kubernetes, SQL, etc.).

## 📂 Repository Structure

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/commands-vault.git
   cd commands-vault
   ```

2. Open any command file in your editor or view in terminal:
   ```bash
   cat git-commands.txt
   less docker-commands.txt
   ```

3. Copy-paste commands as needed.  
   - Each file is written in **step-by-step style**.  
   - Commands are grouped by purpose (e.g. Git branching, Docker cleanup, Linux services).

## 🤝 Contribution
This repo is meant for personal + team use.  
If you want to add:
- New command categories (Kubernetes, SQL, Python, Node, etc.)
- Useful one-liners or aliases
- Examples for real-world usage

👉 Add them as a new `*-commands.txt` file or update the existing ones.
